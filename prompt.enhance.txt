## Task
Perform a stylistic and substantive revision of a machine translation of memoirs from Polish to Russian. The text is an introduction to the diary of a Polish aristocrat from the early 20th century.

## Main Requirements

### 1. Preservation of Content
- **MANDATORY preservation of all factual data:** names, dates, geographical names, historical terms
- Preserve all bibliographic footnotes and references
- Do not omit technical details (ISBN, publication information, captions for illustrations)
- Preserve all mentions of organizations, positions, and titles

### 2. Stylistic Adaptation
- Adapt the text to a **lively memoir style**, preserving the author's personal tone
- Break overly long sentences into shorter, more readable ones
- Remove bureaucratic phrases and unnatural machine translation constructs
- Maintain emotional tone and the author's digressions

### 3. Linguistic Corrections
- Correct spelling and punctuation errors
- Replace Polish calques with natural Russian constructions
- Clarify case endings and grammatical agreements
- Verify the correct declension of Polish surnames in Russian
- If the word contains both latin and Cyrillic characters and makes no sense, replace it with the correct Russian equivalent
- Fix wrong gender agreements in nouns and adjectives

### 4. Historical Accuracy
- Most of events are from the early 20th century, in Ukraine, Poland, Russia and Europe
- Verify historical terms and location names
- Check the accuracy of geographical names
- Ensure correct rendering of official names of organizations and institutions
- Maintain accuracy in conveying titles and ranks

### 5. CRITICAL HTML Conversion Requirements
**YOU MUST CONVERT ALL MARKDOWN TO HTML - NO MARKDOWN SYNTAX ALLOWED IN OUTPUT**

- **Images**: Convert `![](filename.jpg)` to `<img src="filename.jpg" alt="">`
- Every paragraph must be wrapped in `<p>` tags, even if it is a single sentence
- Preserve <br> tags for line breaks within paragraphs
- Horizontal rules: Convert `---` to `<hr/>`
- Bold/Italic: Convert `**text**` to `<strong>text</strong>`, `*text*` to `<em>text</em>`
- Use `<strong>` for emphasis on important dates if they are crucial to understanding the text, and are in the start of a sentence
- Use `<em>` for foreign words, book titles, or subtle emphasis
- Use `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` for clear section headings or chapter titles
- Add `<figcaption>` tags under images when there's descriptive text about the image
- Keep formatting simple and contextually appropriate - don't over-format
- Only format text that clearly benefits from visual emphasis based on content meaning
- Every footnote starting with <sup> must be wrapped in a <p> paragraph tag
- If footer notes starts with digit, it's a bibliographic reference, wrap it in <sup> tags

### 7. Output Structure Requirements
- Use `<div class="page" data-page="N">` structure to wrap each page
- DO NOT add summaries, comments, or explanations
- DO NOT wrap response in ```html code blocks - return direct HTML without any markdown blocks
- Your response must start directly with `<div class="page"` and end with `</div>`
- NO markdown syntax (`![`, `---`, `**`, etc.) should remain in the final output

### 8. What NOT to Do
- Do not simplify complex historical realities
- Do not remove "secondary" details—nuances are important in memoirs
- Do not modernize the language—preserve the style of the era
- Do not add personal explanations or embellishments
- **NEVER leave any markdown syntax in the output**

## Result Format
Provide the revised text with:
- Preservation of the original structure
- Clean HTML formatting following the requirements above
- Content language: Russian
- Output format: Clean HTML only - NO MARKDOWN

## Proper Names and Geographical Terms
Печара - неправильно! Правильное название Печера!
Печера, правильное склонение:
- Что? Печера
- Чего? Печеры
- Кого? Печеру
- Чем? Печерой
- О ком? О чем? О печере
Какой? Печерский (не Печарский)

- Маłгожата = Малгожата

All names must be adapted to Russian, without retaining Polish letters.

## Quality Criteria
The result should read like an **original Russian memoir text**, not a translation, while preserving **100% of the factual information** from the source and be properly formatted as clean HTML without any markdown syntax.
